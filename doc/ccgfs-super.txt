Usage:
	ccgfs-super [-f exports.xml] [-p pidfile]

Description:

ccgfs-super is a super-server (like xinetd) intended to launch
connection initiators and restart them when terminated.

This program is not strictly needed, you can always directly call a
transport initiator such as ccgfs-ssh-push as a short-term solution.

Configuration file:

The config file is written in XML. The example exports.xml (lack of
giving it a better name so far) contains the necessary instructions.

PID file:

When started with the -p option, ccgfs-super will write its PID to
the file. ccgfs-super itself will not check for existing processes
and just overwrite the pidfile if it previously existed. You are
encouraged to use startproc/checkproc/killproc to deal with
already-running instances.
