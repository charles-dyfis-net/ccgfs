Description:

ccgfs-super is a super-server (like xinetd) intended to launch
connection initiators and restart them when terminated.

This program is not strictly needed, you can always directly call a
transport initiator such as ccgfs-ssh-push as a short-term solution.

Configuration file:

The config file is written in XML. The example exports.xml (lack of
giving it a better name so far) provided with the source tarball
should be self-explanatory. There is currently only one tag, <s>
which specifies a subprocess. Everything inside the <s> tag is
considered a simplified shell command (at the time of writing: no
expansion of meta characters, no quoting, etc.):

	<s>ccgfs-ssh-push
		-s /home/jengelh
		-m jengelh@remote:/home/jengelh
	</s>
