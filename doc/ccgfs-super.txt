Description:

ccgfs-super is a super-server (like xinetd) intended to launch connections
(both pull and push based) and restart them when terminated.

This program is not strictly needed, you can always directly call a transport
initiator such as ccgfs-ssh-push as a short-term solution.

Configuration file:

The config file is written in XML. The example exports.xml (it actually also
handles imports) provided with the source tarball should be self-explanatory.
There are two main tags, <export> and <import>. They have the following
attributes:

	<export engine="" srcpath="" target="" destpath="" />

	<import engine="" source="" srcpath="" destpath="" />

'engine' refers to the transport initiator program. This can be ssh-push,
ssh-pull, fifo, or whatever other transport programs are possible. The meaning
of the other attributes 'source', 'srcpath', 'target' and 'destpath' depends on
the particular transport initiator. Currently, these are just passed as
arguments to the initiators.
