v0.74 (September 07 2008)
=========================
- src: update for libHX 1.25
- added quickstart doc


v0.73 (June 22 2008)
====================
- ccgfs-super: fix child process waiting
- ccgfs-super: switch from HXdeque to HXclist
- ccgfs-storage: fix error message when root_dir not found
- ccgfs-storage: prefix some error messages with the program's name


v0.72 (November 26 2007)
========================
This release fixes non-functional chmod (and read/write request
clamping in v0.71). It adds more command line options to the program
launcher so that it can be used by other projects.

- fchmodat() was incorrectly being passed AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW


v0.71 (November 25 2007)
========================
- Added the -p option (pid file) to ccgfs-super
- Added the -s option to ccgfs-super to enable syslog logging
- Fix high CPU use when no subprocesses are active
- Added "reload" method to init.d script
- Protect positive return values from write() from XL
- Disable read/write request size clamping


v0.69 (October 27 2007)
=======================
pread and pwrite syscalls are now used and large writes greater than
8K are properly handled.

- Use pread()/pwrite()
- Do not translate LOCALFS_STOP
- Truncate large write requests (>8192 bytes)


v0.68 (September 17 2007)
=========================
Unaligned accesses on sparc64 were fixed. Hardlinking always returned
ENOENT. A translation layer was added for open() flags since these
are not architecture-agnostic.

- fix unaligned access (sparc64)
- fixed: start script did not start due to missing path
- open() flags also needed translation
- fixed: hardlink always returned ENOENT
- --enable-workarounds only required for < 2.6.16


v0.67 (August 30 2007)
======================
This version works with autoconf 2.59 and kernel versions down to
2.6.18. A mutex underflow has been fixed.

- fixed: net_lock mutex was inadvertently underflown
- fixed: linkat always returned -EINVAL
- added workarounds for kernel < 2.6.22 (sic: 2.6.16)
- build/configure script fixes (also make it work with autoconf 2.59)


v0.66 (August 25 2007)
======================
Lowered requirement to FUSE 2.6.5. Alignment, endianess and encoding
fixes have been applied as a result of testing with sparc64.
Implemented fsync, hardlinking and the rest of the xattr functions.

- encoding changes (size_t should be encoded as 64-bit)
- implement fsync, hardlink, and the rest of the xattr functions
- lower minimum requirement to FUSE 2.6.5
- encoding fixes (errno codes are not the same across architectures)
- alignment fixes (much needed for RISC processors, e.g. SPARC64)
- endianess fixes (needed for big-endian parties, e.g. SPARC)


v0.48 (August 19 2007 23:11)
============================
- mount.c, storage.c: mknod operation implemented
- mount.c: create packet send/receive operation was fixed
- mount.c: ensure network packet ordering in mount daemon


v0.45 (August 19 2007 19:11)
============================
Implemented automatic restart of processes and config reloading in
ccgfs-super. Its options are now also changable through the config file.

Byteswapping is now performed on big-endian machines (since the packet
format is usually little-endian).


v0.33 (August 13 2007 01:23)
============================
Initial version.
