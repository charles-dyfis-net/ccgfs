v0.67 (August 30 2007)
======================
- build/configure script fixes (also make it work with autoconf 2.59)
- added workarounds for kernel < 2.6.22
- fixed: net_lock mutex was inadvertently underflown
- fixed: linkat always returned -EINVAL


v0.66 (August 25 2007)
======================
- lower minimum requirement to FUSE 2.6.5
- alignment fixes (much needed for RISC processors, e.g. SPARC64)
- endianess fixes (needed for big-endian parties, e.g. SPARC)
- encoding fixes (errno codes are not the same across architectures)
- encoding changes (size_t should be encoded as 64-bit)
- implement fsync, hardlink, and the rest of the xattr functions


v0.48 (August 19 2007 23:11)
============================
- mount.c: create packet send/receive operation was fixed
- mount.c: ensure network packet ordering in mount daemon
- mount.c, storage.c: mknod operation implemented


v0.45 (August 19 2007 19:11)
============================
Implemented automatic restart of processes and config reloading in ccgfs-super.
Its options are now also changable through the config file.

Byteswapping is now performed on big-endian machines (since the packet format
is usually little-endian).


v0.33 (August 13 2007 01:23)
============================
Initial version.
