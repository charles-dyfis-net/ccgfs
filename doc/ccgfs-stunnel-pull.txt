Usage:
	ccgfs-stunnel-pull - SOURCE DESTPATH

Example:
	ccgfs-stunnel-pull - ftp.foobar.com:13337 /ftp

Description:

ccgfs-stunnel-pull establishes an SSL connection to the source host using
stunnel and runs the mount daemon on the local side.

At the time of writing, there is no way to specify the source directory on the
pull side, since neither the storage nor mount daemon itself deal with that.
(For example, ssh will do this in ccgfs-ssh-{pull,push}.) The stunnel server
does not have a way to dynamically take options like ssh. This may or may not
be perceived as a feature. Restricting clients to a fixed directory seems A
Good Idea on public servers. Hence, the first option is currently ignored, but
needs to be present for ccgfs-super to work.

The storage-side stunnel configuration looks like this:

	[ccgfs-pull]
	accept   = 13337
	exec     = /usr/sbin/ccgfs-storage
	execargs = ccgfs-storage /SRCPATH
