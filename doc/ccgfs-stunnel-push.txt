Usage:
	ccgfs-stunnel-push SRCPATH TARGET

Example:
	ccgfs-stunnel-push /home www.computergmbh.de:13338

Description:

ccgfs-stunnel-push estabsliehs an SSL connection to the target host using
stunnel and runs the storage daemon on the local side.

There is no way to specify a DESTPATH on the push side. The reason is the
same as for stunnel pull mode (see ccgfs-stunnel-pull.txt).

The mount-side stunnel configuration looks like this:

	[ccgfs-push]
	accept   = 13338
	exec     = /usr/sbin/ccgfs-mount
	execargs = ccgfs-mount /DESTPATH
