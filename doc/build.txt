You need...

	Linux kernel 2.6.22 or up is recommended, but not necessary.
	If using a version less than 2.6.16, configure with
	--enable-workarounds

	gcc
	fuse-devel >= 2.6.5
	libattr-devel
	libxml2-devel
	openssl-devel
	libHX >= 1.25


With Subversion
===============

Download development tree using Git:

	git clone git://dev.medozas.de/ccgfs

Generate configure scripts.

	./autogen.sh;

Continue at "With tarball".


With Tarball
============

Do the usual three(two)-step, with your favorite CFLAGS or configure options.

	./configure CFLAGS=-ggdb3
	make;

and optionally

	make install;

Make sure the binaries are in the default $PATH so that, for example, `ssh
localhost ccgfs-mount` will work.
