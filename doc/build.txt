You need...

	attr-devel
	gcc
	fuse-devel
	linux kernel 2.6.22 [1]
	libxml2-devel
	openssl-devel
	libHX [2]

	[1] 2.6.18 is definitely not working
	    Versions 2.6.19, 2.6.20, 2.6.21 are untested.

	[2] RPM for openSUSE: suser-jengelh repository
	    Tarball: http://jengelh.hopto.org/p/libHX/


With Subversion
===============

Download development tree using the Subversion client:

	svn co https://dev.computergmbh.de/svn/ccgfs/trunk

Generate configure scripts.

	./autogen.sh;

Continue at "With tarball".


With Tarball
============

Do the usual three(two)-step, with your favorite CFLAGS or configure options.

	./configure CFLAGS=-ggdb3
	make;

and optionally

	make install;

Make sure the binaries are in the default $PATH so that, for example, `ssh
localhost ccgfs-mount` will work. (During development, I advise to symlink the
binaries /usr/local/bin/ccgfs-* to ~/ccgfs/src/*)
