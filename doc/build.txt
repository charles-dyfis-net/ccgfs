You need...

	linux kernel 2.6.22 is recommended, but not necessary.
	If using a version less than 2.6.22, configure with --enable-at-wrap

	gcc
	fuse-devel
	libattr-devel
	libxml2-devel
	openssl-devel
	libHX [1]


	[1] RPM for openSUSE: suser-jengelh repository
	    Tarball: http://jengelh.hopto.org/p/libHX/


With Subversion
===============

Download development tree using the Subversion client:

	svn co https://dev.computergmbh.de/svn/ccgfs/trunk

Generate configure scripts.

	./autogen.sh;

Continue at "With tarball".


With Tarball
============

Do the usual three(two)-step, with your favorite CFLAGS or configure options.

	./configure CFLAGS=-ggdb3
	make;

and optionally

	make install;

Make sure the binaries are in the default $PATH so that, for example, `ssh
localhost ccgfs-mount` will work. (During development, I advise to symlink the
binaries /usr/local/bin/ccgfs-* to ~/ccgfs/src/*)
