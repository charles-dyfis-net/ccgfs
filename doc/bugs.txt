Known Bugs

 * non-local transfers can be slow
   (if someone has an idea how to fix that, speak up)

 * Aurora SPARC Linux's glibc seems to have a locking bug in
   malloc/realloc; if you run the ccgfs-mount daemon on such a
   system, it will need to be run in single-threaded mode ("-s"
   option). I have temporarily added the "-1" option to the
   ccgfs-ssh-push initiator that will do so.
