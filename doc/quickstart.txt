Quickstart.


The most common use-case for ccgfs is the push mode where a
filesystem in the local area network is exported to the DMZ using
SSH, and the storage side runs ccgfs-super.

Three steps:

1. Make sure that ccgfs is installed on the target machine where the
filesystem should eventually be mounted, and that the binaries are in
the $PATH.

2. Create a ccgfs-super.xml file in the system configuration
directory. The --sysconfdir= parameter that was passed to ./configure
sets that directory, and it defaults to /usr/local/etc. You usually
want it to be /etc.

The contents of ccgfs-super.xml:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ccgfs-super>
<kill-margin>5</kill-margin>
<restart-wait>10</restart-wait>
<s>ccgfs-ssh-push -s /export -m root@dmzmachine:/import</s>
</ccgfs-super>

That's it.

3. Launch the ccgfs-super daemon, usually by invoking the
/etc/init.d/ start script.
