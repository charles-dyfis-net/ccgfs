Usage:
	ccgfs-fifo -M mount.fifo -S storage.fifo -s SRCPATH -m MOUNTPOINT

Example:
	ccgfs-fifo -M /path/to/storage.fifo -S /path/to/mount.fifo
                   -s /from -m /to

Description:

ccgfs-fifo establishes a pseudo-connection through two named pipes (FIFOs).
Since pipes' scope is the local host only, this transport initiator's
usefulness is mostly testing, or to mimic the (privileged) `mount --bind`
operation.
